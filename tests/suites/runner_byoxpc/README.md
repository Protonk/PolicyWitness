# runner_byoxpc

Runner suite for BYOXPC services. It installs a BYOXPC runner, runs the shared
smoke and blackbox scripts through `runner.mode=byoxpc`, and validates
`runner_kind` in the output.

## Invariants

- Requires launchd bootstrap from a logged-in GUI session.
- Installs a BYOXPC runner under the user scope and removes it after the suite.
- Shared smoke and blackbox scripts receive `PW_TEST_RUNNER_MODE=byoxpc` and the
  installed service name.
